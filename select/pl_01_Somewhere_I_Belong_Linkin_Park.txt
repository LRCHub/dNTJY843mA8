When this began
I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in
The nothingness inside of me
I was confused
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person
With these things in mind
Inside of me
But all the vacancy
The words revealed
Is the only real thing
That I've got left to feel
Nothing to lose
Just stuck
Hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
And the fault is my own
I want to heal
I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain
I've held so long
[Erase all the pain
'til it's gone]
I want to heal
I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something
I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall
Right down on my face
I was confused
Looking everywhere
Only to find that it's
Not the way I had imagined
It all in my mind
So what am I
what do I have but negativity
‘Cause I can't justify the
Way everyone is looking at me
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
Hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
The fault is my own
I want to heal
I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain
I've held so long
[Erase all the pain
'til it's gone]
I want to heal
I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something
I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I will never know
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else
Until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I
Break away from me
And I will break away
I'll find myself today
I want to heal
I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain
I've held so long
[Erase all the pain
'til it's gone]
I want to heal
I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something
I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I want to heal
I want to feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I want to heal
I want to feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
