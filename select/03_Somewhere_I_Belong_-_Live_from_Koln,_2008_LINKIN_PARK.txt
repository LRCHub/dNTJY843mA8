(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) When all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to loose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everwhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to loose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along (you sing)
Somewhere I belong

And I will never know
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else until my wounds are healed
And I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away
I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
